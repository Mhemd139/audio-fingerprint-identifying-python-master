# Audio Fingerprint Identification in Python

This repository contains Python scripts for identifying audio fingerprints using spectrograms. Below, we explain the spectrograms used in the techniques implemented in this repository.

## Spectrograms

### What are Spectrograms?

Spectrograms are visual representations of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. They are used extensively in audio signal processing for tasks such as visualizing the frequency content of a signal over time, identifying patterns, and extracting features for analysis.

### Spectrogram Techniques Implemented

#### 1. Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)

The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is a widely used technique for calculating spectrograms. It breaks the signal into short segments, typically overlapping, and computes the Fourier Transform for each segment. This results in a time-frequency representation of the signal, where the intensity of each frequency component is represented as a function of time.

#### 2. Constant-Q Transform (CQT)

The Constant-Q Transform (CQT) is another technique for generating spectrograms, particularly useful for analyzing audio signals with varying pitch. Unlike the STFT, which uses a linear scale for frequency bins, the CQT uses a logarithmic scale. This allows for better resolution at lower frequencies, which is beneficial for tasks such as audio fingerprinting where low-frequency components are often crucial.

#### 3. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)

While not strictly a spectrogram, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are commonly used as features extracted from spectrograms for tasks such as speech and audio processing. MFCCs capture the spectral characteristics of audio signals in a compact form by applying a series of processing steps, including the computation of a Mel-scaled spectrogram, taking the logarithm of the power spectrum, and applying the discrete cosine transform.
